	Substation = "Power Substation"
	SubstationIcon = "Substation"
	SubstationDesc = "A substation capable of inserting or pulling power out of a cable network. It will automatically send power to all blocks around.\n\n"\
				"Substations must be used to send power to nearby blocks, as cables cannot do that naturally."

	Substation2 = "Wireless Substation"
	Substation2Icon = "Wireless Substation"
	Substation2Desc = "A specialized form of wireless power projector capable of sending power to blocks (on the same ship) in a straight line from projector head."
	
	PowerStorageDesc = "Stores a limited cache of plasma batteries that may be used by nearby ship's systems or pushed to a cable network."
	
	Cable = "Cable (Corridor)"
	CableIcon = "Cable (Corridor)"
	CableDesc = "A length of cable that runs through a corridor, the thinner floor plate means crew have to be more careful walking over it. These transmit power from substations or capacitors to substations.\n\n"\
				"Cables do not deliver power directly to parts, and must deliver to a substation next to those parts."
	
	CableAR1 = "Cable (Armor 1x1)"
	CableAR2 = "Cable (Armor 1x2)"
	CableARIcon = "Cable (Armor)"
	CableARDesc = "A length of cable that runs through some armor, reducing the ability to absorb damage. These transmit power from substations or capacitors to substations.\n\n"\
				"Cables do not deliver power directly to parts, and must deliver to a substation next to those parts."

	ReactorCore = "Modular Reactor Core"
	ReactorCoreIcon = "Nuclear Core"
	ReactorCoreDesc = "Controlled fission of enriched uranium allows the reactor to heat up water into steam, which can then be sent via pipes to systems capable of using it."
	
	WBoiler = "High Pressure Steam Boiler (Planned)"
	WBoilerIcon = "Steam Boiler"
	WBoilerDesc = "A boiler that burns carbon-derived fuel to generate steam for the power plant, requires a specialized ventilation system that ejects the burnt remnants into space."

	VTEEngine = "Vertical Triple Expansion Engine (Planned)"
	VTEEngineIcon = "Triple Expansion Engine"
	VTEEngineDesc = "A series of three pistons which intake steam to rotate a shaft, which can be turned into power much the same way as a turbine, this process is quite inefficient and the vibrations may stun crew."
	
	Turbine = "Steam Turbine"
	TurbineIcon = "Turbine"
	TurbineDesc = "A turbine that can convert high pressure steam into power, this system requires active supervision to function properly, and is notably not 100% efficient.\n\n"\
				"This part is WIP and as such does not currently have all damage sprites, this will change in the future. Requires attached transformer to extract usable power."

	ThermalLoop = "Steam-Water Loop Pipe"
	ThermalLoopIcon = "Steam Pipe"
	ThermalLoopDesc = "A pair of pipes that carry steam one way, and water the other way, this carries heat energy to anywhere it needs to be."
	
	ThermalLoopPass = "Steam-Water Loop Pipe (Passable)"
	ThermalLoopPassIcon = "Steam Pipe (Passable)"
	ThermalLoopPassDesc = "A pair of pipes that carry steam one way, and water the other way, this carries heat energy to anywhere it needs to be, there is a passageway across this set of pipes, for crew to cross via."
	
	Transformer = "Power Transformer"
	TransformerIcon = "Transformer"
	TransformerDesc = "A high power electrical conversion system that can feed immense amounts of power into a grid, MMCT denies all allegations that this is a robot in disguise.\n\n"\
				"This part is WIP and will change visually as MMCT is updated."
